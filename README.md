# Tanzania Nationwide Mills Census - Webmap

This repo queries odk central server and updates a webmap automatically. Currently specific to a project in Tanzania funded by The World Food Programme (WFP) and executed by OpenMap Development Tanzania (OMDTZ).

## Infrastructure set-up
The map is composed of two main components, which are 
- Data collection server (www.omdtz-data.org)
- Web-map  (www.millmaps.org)

### Requirements for deploying data collection server
For server deployment, you are needed to prepare the following 
- Domain name. In our case, we bought a domain from https://www.namecheap.com/
- Server for hosting, in our case we used https://cloud.digitalocean.com/ 
- During data Collection, specifications for the server used was
  - Ubuntu Docker 19.03.12 on Ubuntu 20.04 
    - Size 
      - 2 vCPUs 
      - RAM 4GB / 80GB Disk
      - Cost ($28/mo). Additional external 150GB SSD cost ($15/mo)
- After data collection, deploying the new server will not require the same server specifications because the traffic will be low and amount of data will not be as much as during actual data collection. For this reasons, the specifications will be;
   - Ubuntu Docker 19.03.12 on Ubuntu 20.04 (version of docker doesn't matter, you can opt for the available higher version)
     - Size 
       - 1 vCPU 
       - RAM 1GB / 25GB Disk
       - Cost ($6/mo)
-  We also added the external 150GB SSD to support pictures and data hosting but for now we can aim for minimal specifications because we are not expecting a large amount of data to be uploaded.

### Requirements for deploying web-map
For Web-map, you are needed to prepare the following 
- Domain name, because it uses "let’s encrypt" for the SSL, you should provide the domain in the very early stage. In our case, we bought a domain from https://www.namecheap.com/
- Server for hosting, in our case we used https://cloud.digitalocean.com/. 
  - Specifications for the 
    - Image Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) x64 
    - Size 
      - 1 vCPU 
      - RAM 1GB / 25GB Disk
      - Cost ($6/mo)
  

### Steps for deploying data collection server
- Creating new droplets
  - Creating an account in the digital ocean
  - Launch a droplet; At the very top, under Choose an image, switch to the Marketplace tab and select the Docker option. The docker version does not matter, and the system will run on ubuntu 20.04 or higher. 
  - Choose the size of droplets; basicaly you can reffer "Requirements for deploying data collection server"
  - Choose Authentication Method; for more security, we recommend ssh but you can also opt to password
  - Create and rename the droplets.

  - Buy a domain from your provider such as https://www.namecheap.com/, https://www.godaddy.com/, https://yatosha.com/
  - In digital ocean 
    - Right-click on the 3 dots after the droplets you created
![Alt text](/app/static/static_figures/domain.png?raw=true "Title")
    - Click add domain
      - Add the domain name you bought eg millmaps.org
      - Add CNAME as *
      - Copy all the name servers which are 
        - ns1.digitalocean.com. 
        - Ns2.digitalocean.com.
        - Ns3.digitalocean.com.
![Alt text](/app/static/static_figures/domain-ocean.png?raw=true "Title")
  - From Domain name service providers. i.e Namecheap
    - Click manage, on the right of the domain you just bought
    - Navigate to name servers, change the section to custom DNS then add all the nameservers copied from the digital ocean which are 
      - Ns1.digitalocean.com. 
      - Ns2.digitalocean.com.
      - Ns3.digitalocean.com.

*Sometimes it takes up to 24 hours for domain to reflect*

- Installing Data collection server (ODK central)
  - From your terminal, ssh to the server; you can use the IP address provided and username as root. If the domain has already been reflected you can use it.
  - Start by updating and upgrading the OS 
  - Then upgrade the server
    ```
    sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
    ```
  - Start up the docker by running
  ```
  systemctl enable docker
  ```
  - Modify system firewall by running
  ```
  ufw disable 
  ```
   and it will prompt "Firewall stopped and disabled on system startup"
  - Download the application; 
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/getodk/central
  ```
  - Navigate to central directory by typing cd central
  - Add the missing components, and make sure you are in the central directory and paste the following; 
  ```
  git submodule update -i
  ```
  - Copy the template so as you can be able to edit it
  ```
  mv .env.template .env
  ```
  - Then edit the file and add domain and emails as follows
    - Type nano .env the text editor will be launched and
      - #Use fully qualified domain names. Set to DOMAIN=local if SSL_TYPE=selfsign.
      DOMAIN=omdtz-data.org (added domain name)
      - #Used for Let's Encrypt expiration emails and Enketo technical support emails
      SYSADMIN_EMAIL=iddichazua6@gmail.com (added email)
      - #Options: letsencrypt, customssl, upstream, selfsign
      SSL_TYPE=letsencrypt
      - #Do not change if using SSL_TYPE=letsencrypt
      - HTTP_PORT=80
      - HTTPS_PORT=443
  ![Alt text](/app/static/static_figures/server.png?raw=true "Title")
    - Start installing the server by typing; 
    ```
    docker-compose build
    ```
    - Start the server; 
    ```
    docker-compose up -d
    ``` 
- Logging into the server and adding user(s)
  - Ensure that you are in the central folder on your server. 
  - Adding users ( Substituting your email address as appropriate. Press Enter, and you will be asked for a password for this new account.)
  ```
  docker-compose exec service odk-cmd --email YOUREMAIL@ADDRESSHERE.com user-create
  ```
  - Make the user as admin 
  ```
  docker-compose exec service odk-cmd --email YOUREMAIL@ADDRESSHERE.com user-promote
  ```
  
  - You are done for now, but if you ever lose track of your password, you can always reset it by typing 
  ```
  docker-compose exec service odk-cmd --email YOUREMAIL@ADDRESSHERE.com user-set-password
  ```
  - As with account creation, you will be prompted for a new password after you press Enter.

## Web map installation

### Cloud deployment
- Create a Digital Ocean droplet (or other server on whatever infrastructure you prefer), and associate a domain name with it. Either disable the UFW firewall or poke the appropriate holes in it for nginx and ssh.
 - Modify firewall system by running
```
ufw disable 
```
 - Create a user called ```millsmap``` with sudo privileges, 

```
  sudo adduser millsmap    # Enter password, name, etc
  sudo usermod -aG sudo millsmap
  sudo mkdir /home/millsmap/.ssh
  sudo cp .ssh/authorized_keys /home/millsmap/.ssh/
  sudo chown hot-admin /home/millsmap/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
- From the ```millsmap``` user account, clone this repo. Step into it with 
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/OMDTZ/MillsMap
 ```
- ```cd MillsMap```.
- You'll need a file called ```secret_tokens.json``` that contains "username" and "password" for an ODK Central server containing your mill map data.
- Run the installation script with 
  ```
  script/setup.sh
  ```
  - Follow instructions. It needs the domain name, and your email so that "Let's Encrypt" can inform you when your certificate is expiring.

- Note: 
  - To change an odk central server: /app/config.py
  - To track submitted  files: /app/submission_files
  - Mills picture: /app/static/figures/
  - To add new form: /app/static/form_config.csv


## How to set up survey in data server and updating the map
### Surveying setting up in data server
  - Log in to the server
  - Create the project, by clicking add new button in ODK central.
![Alt text](/app/static/static_figures/add_project.png?raw=true "Title")

  - Then add survey forms; in our case, we have Zanzibar_Mills_Mapping_Census_Updating_V_0.11.xlsx for Zanzibar and Tanzania_Mainland_Mills_Mapping_Census_Updating_V_0.12.xlsx for Tanzania mainland which can be access here https://github.com/OMDTZ/MillsMap/tree/main/sample_forms
![Alt text](/app/static/static_figures/add_form.png?raw=true "Title")
  - After adding each form, deploy them and make sure all the permissions are activated 
  

### Updating the Map  - Using ODK
- Make sure you're using the server linked with webmap during the webmap installation stage
- In Mobile phone, install ODK from playstore then click configure with QR code then scan the provided QR Code from your server
- Set your identity; Open ODK >setting> user and device  identity>form metadata> type your user-name, phone number and email address 
- Open Your ODK application and you will find 5 options
  - Fill blank form 
  - Edit saved form 
  - Send finalized form 
  - View sent form 
  - Delete saved form
- In “Fill blank form”, you will find the deployed form, select and fill the information. 
- NB Please make sure you turn on location, to do so, go to setting on your android then turn on LOCATION.After that fill information. 
Then use the “Send finalized form” option, select all the forms and send them
